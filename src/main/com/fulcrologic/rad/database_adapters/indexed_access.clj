(defn ^:deprecated index-scan
  "Prefer tuple-index-scan over this function when possible. Direct index access is faster.

   Scan a range of the index on `attribute` (which may be a tuple or regular attribute)
   starting at the given `start` value with the given `offset` (default 0). The results are optionally
   filtered by `predicate`, and the scan terminates with a page of `limit` (default 10).

   The `env` must include:

   `::attr/key->attribute` - The map from keyword to RAD attribute for any key used in this function.
   `:datomic-api/datoms` - A Datomic-client compatible `datoms` function. On-prem must be adapted to fix
   `:datomic-api/index-pull` - A Datomic-client compatible `index-pull` function. On-prem API matches. You may want to
     use a custom index pull when on client in order to modify the network behavior. The default index pull
     in cloud (at the time of this writing) is overly aggressive at read-ahead.

   The options map contains:

   `attributes` (REQUIRED unless `selector`) is a list of attributes *that can be on the resolved entity* which you want to pull
   into the result maps. These can be refs or scalars, but the search `attribute`'s `identities` must
   be a non-empty intersection for them to appear. Any ref attributes pulled will automatically be converted to an
   acceptable RAD format. For example, If using native IDs this means that pulling something like `:purchase/customer`
   will return `{:purchase/customer {:customer/id 42}}` instead of `{:purchase/customer {:db/id 42}}`. Normally
   you should use this and allow EQL resolvers to resolve any nesting; however, if you want exact control of the
   pull query use `selector` instead.

   `selector` (REQUIRED unless `attributes`). The Datomic pull selector. Used when you don't want one constructed
   from `attributes`. Will be used as-is instead of constructing a pull selector from `attributes` (which is then
   no longer needed).

   The `predicate` will be passed each item before it is accumulated in order to filter them out.
   Doing so causes additional steps in the scan to accumulate up to `limit`, and should be done
   carefully (e.g. it is generally ok to filter out things that appear randomly (somewhat evenly distributed)
   in the order being scanned, but filtering out things that are common will result in a
   very inefficient scan of a large portion of the index, and should be accomplished using
   other means (a new tuple or a direct `q`).

   `start` (required) must match the attribute's type. For tuples this means
   it must be a vector of values that are compatible with the underlying tuple (and nil has meaning to
   Datomic in this case). The start MAY use a native value on refs whose target RAD attribute is a non
   native identity. Doing so will
   internally do the proper conversion on the Datomic index to native, and the `predicate` and `while` will
   see the *non-native* value if the target reference attribute in RAD is non-native.

   The `while` condition is a `(fn [item] boolean?)` that will receive each item as it is
   found (pre-filtering with predicate) and must return `true` if you
   expect there are more interesting results, and `false` if you are done with the scan.

   `reverse?` reverses the order of the scan, but you must made sure `start` correctly picks the highest
   value desired in that case.

   Returns a map with:

   ```
   {:next-offset N
    :results [{pulled data} ...]}

   `N` will be -1 if you reached the end of the index range (`max`). This allows you to call this function
   with that as your `offset` in order to get the next page of results.

   WARNING: Index scanning continues until the end of the given index UNLESS you specify a while condition. You
   *should* usually supply one.

(defn search-parameters->range+filters
  "Convert (RAD report) search paramters into an argument list that is usable by tuple-index-scan.

   pathom-env - A Pathom env that includes additions from RAD plugins (at least attribute and RAD Datomic)
   tuple-attribute - The tuple that will be scanned
   k->a - The RAD attribute lookup map (keyword -> attribute)
   search-parameters - Valid search parameters

   Search is a map of keys that are part of the tuple, and can include, for a key :ns/nm in the tuple:

   `:ns/nm value` - A specific value that exactly matches the schema type of that key
   `:ns/nm uuid(s)` - IF the key is a ref (many or one), then UUIDs are acceptable even though the low-level value
     will be integer(s). This function will use the database in the `pathom-env` to convert such UUIDs to their low-level
     :db/id.
   `:ns/nm ident(s)` - Same as the uuid case above.
   `:ns/nm (fn [v] boolean)` - A predicate function. Of course the client cannot pass code, so to use this you'd have
     to leverage the `iao/pathom-env->search-parameters` option on the tuple to convert incoming parameters into a predicate.
   `:ns.nm/start value` - A value of the correct type that should act as a starting value of a range. Primarily used for inst.
   `:ns.nm/end value` - A value of the correct type that should act as an EXCLUSIVE ending value of a range. Primarily used for inst.
     NOTE: The default system will coerce local dates to the end of the (timezone-appropriate) date (e.g. midnight the next day)
   `:ns.nm/subset #{value...}` - A subset of values that are acceptable for the `:ns/nm` element of the tuple.

   Returns a map containing:

   ```
   {:range {:start tuple-compatible-inclusive-value
            :end tuple-compatible-exclusive-value}
    :filters tuple-compatible-filter-map}
   ```

   Additional Notes:

   * If you include a value or start-without-an-end for a tuple attribute that will be used in the `range`
     (determined by left-to-right scanning of the tuple order), then the multimethod `exclusive-end` will be used on
     that value to derive the end. This has built-in implementations for String (add \u0000 to the end), Date (+ 1ms),
     Integer, and Long (inc).
   * The `iao/coerce` setting on attribute within the tuple (e.g. tuple contains :invoice/date, then the attribute invoice-date
     is the one we mean), then that function will be used to coerce the incoming search parameter to a compatible value. The
     `default-coercion` handles:
     ** fixing UUID/idents on refs
     ** LocalDateTime (to inst)
     ** LocalDate (to inst). If the search parameter is using `:ns.nm/end`, then it will be pushed to end-of-day
        (midnight next day), otherwise it will use local time midnight as the time.

(defn tuple-index-scan
  "Given a RAD `tuple-attr` with the `do/attribute-schema` option that specifies `:db/tupleAttrs`: search that tuple
   via index-range on `db`. The `pathom-env` shouuld include the items installed by the datomic and attribute RAD plugins.

   `start` and `end` are values of the tuple to use as the total range to scan. See `d/index-range`.

   `filters` is a map whose keys are attributes in the tuple, and whose values are *either* constant values of that attribute's type, or
   are predicate functions `(fn [v] bool?)` that receive that attribute's value (not the whole tuple). Any attributes that are missing
   in this map will accept any value in the tuple. Using `nil` for a filter value is valid, and will keep only entities for which that
   attribute is missing. The special key `:row-filter` can be used in place of tuple keys in order to supply a predicate
   `(fn [tuple-value] boolean?)`. All filters are combined with AND logic, so using a row-filter is necessary if you want
   to create more complex row conditions.

   `options` can include:

    * `:reverse?` Reverses the result order
    * `:sort-column` A keyword (of an attribute in the tuple) on which you want to sort.
    * `:selector` A pull-query selector
    * `:maps?` Turn the tuple into a map (including :db/id). Faster than `selector`, but limited to the tuple's
       content.
    * `:include-total?` Includes a `:total` in the result, which is a count of all possible results
    * `:offset` (default 0) A starting offset of the results you want. A number between 0 and total - 1.
    * `:limit` (default 1000) A limit on the number of items returned. When NOT using a selector it
      is very fast to get large numbers of results; however, when using a `selector`
      you should keep this limit small, since you are making additional round-trips to the database
      to pull non-indexed details for each item.

   WARNING: `:sort-column`, `:reverse?` and `:include-total?` MUST run through as much of the index as start/end
   dictate. This is usually fast, but can get expensive on very large data sets (you should measure on your hardware for
   a start/end segment of over 100k items).

   Returns:

   ```
   {:results [...]
    :total n ; if you specified :include-total?
    :next-offset n}
   ```

   where `:results` will be one of:

   * A vector of maps for the `:selector` or `:maps?` options.
   * A vector of the datoms

   The `:next-offset` is -1 if there are no more possible results. It will be positive if there are more results,
   and can be used as the `offset` to get items starting at the next available item.

   EXAMPLE:

   You could scan an attribute of some entity `item` that has date, email, and sent? fields using this:

   ```
   (tuple-index-scan db pathom-env date+email+sent? [#inst \"2022-01-01\"] [#inst \"2022-01-02\"]
     {:item/email (fn [email] (str/ends-with? email \"gmail.com\"))
      :item/sent? true}
     {:limit 10})
   ```

   to find the items where the email ends in \"gmail.com\" and whose sent? flag is true.

   NOTES:

   * This function expects exact type matching on the tuple. Use `search-params->range+filters` to fix up search parameters
     from a (RAD) UI.
   * The start and end can contain any number of elements (up to the tuple size), but they are Datomic index-range start/end,
     and doing so may or may not be what you want. If you're trying to actually limit the *range* then they are what you want, but if you need to filter
     a wide range, then be sure to use filters instead. For example, say you have invoices with numbers, and a tuple that has
     owner+number+status. A start/end of `[A 1]` `[A 2]` will get you A's invoice number 1 (only). Filters are applied after the range. If you
     want all of the invoices owned by `A` with some status then you'd use `[A]` as start and `[(inc A)]` as end, with a filter
     of `{:invoice/status some-status}`.
